This analysis project seeks to visualize the data of Citi Bike's bike share program, specifically during August 2019 in NYC. Using Tableau and Pandas, we attempt to discern the different gender-related data on:
- checkout bikes, time and gender distribution
- bike usage during the week by day and hour, by gender
- subscribed users vs customers
- geographical distribution by gender
- bike repair

## Results

CitiBike offers an incredible program to the community which allows commuting to be done fast and easy with their 2,344,224 bikes present in August of 2019 alone. The trend of its usage shows that bikes are being used not only for work commute but also for recreational purposes, with their main demographical interest being in subscribed users, specifically men. 

Further visualization may allow for understanding what precisely causes this gender divide in bike usage and locale, as well as further research on age utilized to better understand the nuance of trends we see in this analysis.
